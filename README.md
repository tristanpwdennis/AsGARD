## An. stephensi Genomics and Resistance Diagnostics

This repo will contain all the code for the CEASE (https://www.ceasemalaria.org) genomics work package. At the moment, it contains a few helper scripts and analysis notebooks (notebooks), as I tidy everything off of LSTM's servers to prepare these data for publication.
